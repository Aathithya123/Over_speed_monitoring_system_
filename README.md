# Over_speed_monitoring_system_
This project introduces a concise yet effective Arduino-based speed
monitoring system. By incorporating an ultrasonic sensor and a 16x2
LCD display, the system achieves precise real-time measurement of
object speed. An embedded threshold feature promptly triggers an
"over-speeding" alert if the speed limit is exceeded. This professionalgrade solution significantly contributes to road safety initiatives and
enhances transportation systems by promoting responsible driving
practices.

COMPONENTS USED
1) Arduino UNO
2) UltraSonic sensor HC-SR04
3) LCD-Display 16x2
4) I2C module
